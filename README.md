# Horiseon-Challenge
Week 1 Module Challenge
Horiseon is a marketing agency that wants their code base to follow accessibility standards.
This will help their own site be optimized for search engines.

The code, while working, needed to be refactored with all the <div> elements replace with more up to date HTML elements.
All <image> elements have been given <alt> text, making them more accessible. 

The CSS has been updated and consoladated where classes for multiple sections had the same class atributes.
